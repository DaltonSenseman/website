      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>I am Dalton R. Senseman a software engineering major at Florida Gulf Coast University. I was brought up in a militaristic family so organization and leaderships skills have been engrained into me since I was a small child. In high school I was apart of the J.R.O.T.C. Program and earned the rank of Sargent Major, with this rank I oversaw over 200 cadets with display actions, running events and instructing others in how to be better organized and attentive to details. I won a multitude of awards during my time in J.R.O.T.C. enforcing the leadership I have obtained. I finished high school with honors before moving onto college.</p>
      <p>Outside of school and study I have worked for seven years at Publix Super Markets, as a Bakery Clerk.  I hope to get accepted into the company’s IT departments as a Software programmer but if not, I aim to work for: Microsoft, Riot Games, Intel, Blizzard, or Nvida. Recreationally I love to ride my Yamaha Vstar250 motorcycle or find the time to go scuba diving around Florida. I am also an avid gamer and enjoy playing a wide variety of computer-based games from RTS to MMORPG’s I find them both therapeutic and a learning experience as I modify the games and mess around inside of them to learn how the larger companies put the game together.</p>
      <p>I hope with the experience with my time at F.G.C.U. I will learn more about coding and be able to apply what I have learned into my next area of employment. With what I wish to do with my degree once I have earned it I hope to expand my knowledge in operating systems, server systems, engines, and virtual reality. I believe my path of learning doesn’t stop at graduation but opens even more doors to learn more and expand and diversify my skills, life is about learning at every step along the way. </p>
